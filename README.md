# Game_name

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Game_name</strong> is a tower defense game created in unity by a couple of polish high school students, trying to not fail that hard for a third time in the Ludum Dare game jam. The team consisted of 2 person art department, a seasoned starcraft player, windows normies making spaghetti and some linux weebs making quality spaghetti.</p>

They managed to make something in 72 hours, something they called v1.0.
